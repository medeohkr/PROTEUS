   Preamble

   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the term "copyleft" to describe this general method for making a program free, and requiring all modified versions to be free as well.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the permission to share, modify, and use the software you receive. For a more detailed discussion of what we mean by free software, you can refer to 
   [GNU's Philosophy about Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/)
